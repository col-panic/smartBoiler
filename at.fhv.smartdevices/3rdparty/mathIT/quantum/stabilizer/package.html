Provides classes to simulate quantum stabilizer states.
These are special quantum register states which are obtained from
a computational basis state by a restricted class of quantum gates,
the local Clifford operators and the c-NOT gate.
Quantum algorithms using only these quantum gates are
efficiently implementable on a classical computer, due to
the Gottesman-Knill theorem.
<p>
The classes of this package implement the graph state formalism
by Anders and Briegel, which is the most fastest simulation
of quantum stabilizer state algorithms known so far.
