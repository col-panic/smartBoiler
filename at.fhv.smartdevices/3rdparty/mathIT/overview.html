The <code>mathIT</code> mathematics library provides classes and methods for direct use
in Java&#x2122;. It covers the mathematical areas of algebra, number theory,
approximation theory, statistics, and graph theory,
but also provides methods to plot function graphs, to parse functions
from strings (in usual infix and prefix notation), to implement
quantum registers and quantum algorithms, or to use the genetic code.
